## How it works

```
22:30 UTC daily  (~4:00 AM IST, reaches you by 4:30 AM)
|
|- fetch_github_trending.py     GitHub REST API (2 passes)   -> data/repos.json
|- fetch_competitions.py        Unstop / Devpost / MLH       -> data/competitions.json
|- fetch_hackernews_rss.py      HNRSS                        -> data/hn.json
|- fetch_word_of_day.py         Free Dictionary API          -> data/word_of_day.json
|- rank_hot_topics.py           Groq llama-3.1-8b            -> data/hot_topics.json
|- build_dashboard_data.py      merge + 7d history           -> data/data.json
|- generate_audio.py            edge-tts x4 voices           -> docs/audio/*.mp3
|
git commit + push -> GitHub Pages redeploys automatically
```

Each script fails independently. One broken source does not affect the others.

## Frontend features

**Word of the day** — hero section, changes daily, definition + example.

**Theme toggle** — dark (default) and light, saved to localStorage.

**Hot picks** — 8 cards with guaranteed diversity: 2 from each of repos, HN, competitions, plus 2 wildcards from whichever category has the strongest signal that day.

**Pinning** — bookmark any card. Pinned items appear in a bar at the top and survive nightly refreshes until you remove them.

**Audio popup** — 4 pre-generated MP3s (Neerja, Prabhat, Guy, Ryan). Controls: play/pause, restart, skip 15s, seek bar, playback speed, voice selector.

**Scrollable sections** — Rising Repos and Open Hackathons each have their own scroll container.

**Health indicator** — quiet warning if data is more than 25 hours old.

**Monday mode** — repos trending across multiple days surface first, competitions closing within 7 days get a countdown badge.

## Configuration

Edit `config/sources.yaml` — no code changes needed.

```yaml
competitions:
  sources:
    - name: MLH
      mlh_year: 2026   # update every January

audio:
  voices:
    - name: "Neerja (Indian English)"
      voice: "en-IN-NeerjaNeural"
      file: "morning_neerja.mp3"
    # add or remove voices here
```

---

## Running locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucky191234/aakh.git
cd aakh
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # add GH_TOKEN and GROQ_API_KEY

python scripts/fetch_github_trending.py
python scripts/fetch_competitions.py
python scripts/fetch_hackernews_rss.py
python scripts/fetch_word_of_day.py
python scripts/rank_hot_topics.py
python scripts/build_dashboard_data.py
python scripts/generate_audio.py

# open docs/index.html in browser
```

---

## Hardcoded assumptions to review

| Item | Location | Action needed |
|---|---|---|
| MLH season year | `config/sources.yaml` → `mlh_year` | Update every January |
| Groq model | `scripts/rank_hot_topics.py` | Update if Groq deprecates the model |
| edge-tts voices | `config/sources.yaml` → `audio.voices` | Update if Microsoft retires a voice |

---

## Roadmap

- Activity tracker — git log + browser history signal for genuinely personal ranking
- Playwright fallback for JS-rendered scrape targets
- Mobile PWA — offline audio, lock screen controls
